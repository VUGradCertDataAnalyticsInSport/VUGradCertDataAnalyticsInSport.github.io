- Statements such as "I see them moving together like a flock of birds" or "Its not just a matter of running more than the opposing team, if we are organised, we may even run less" contradict popular beliefs and mechanistic views in sports analytics and coaching that events happen in sport in a reductionist manner
- Here we have an NBA team responding to the ball and a match event in a synchronise manner. This is of course is one incident and a snapshot from a larger game, that could be chance, but a small example of teams moving collectively together in response to an event
- These athletes are responding to events happening within their environment (missed shot on goal)

- Coordination dynamics, is one approach to look at this complexity and is is defined as the science of coordination, that describes, explains, and predicts how patterns of coordination form, adapt, persist, and change in living things.
-  The aim of this field of work is to understand principles and laws that lead the dynamics of behavioural pattern formation under changing constraints (i.e., boundary conditions). 
- These constraints may be classified into three sub-classes: Task constraints, personal constraints, and environmental constraints (talk more about ecological dynamics and constraints led approach soon)
- Defining coordination dynamics is challenging, given the interactions between physiological and psychological processes, that alter under these constraints 
- Similarly, understanding How and which constraints lead to which spontaneous reorganizations of intra-personal and inter-personal coordination requires a great deal of time and energy
- Put simply, rather than focusing on what athletes or perfomers do, we can start to focus on why and how they do it

- The scientific analysis of team sports has tended to focus in the main on identifying discrete performance variables, and reporting on their instances using descriptive measures such as data frequencies, and action sequence chains.
- Coordination patterns of sports behavior emerge as a result of constantly changing conditions for players and/or team
- Behavior on the game and its sub-phases should be viewed as an adapting selforganizing process whose patterned features emerge from the playing interactions operating under various constraints
- Informational constraints, such as the location of the ball and individual players, may be important in shaping the behavioral coordination dynamics
- This research looked at how team sport athletes (in this case, Futsal) move, in relation to each other and the ball, as a as self-organizing complex system
- Here we have a schematic view of the pitch (attacking half only) and futusal player identities based on team membership and starting positions (A – Attackers and D – Defenders). The positions and ball were recorded via computer vision (talk more about this technology in another session)
- The weaker phase attraction to the ball for the attackers is denoted by increased phase variability, a feature of meta-stable dynamical systems that promote the likelihood of system transitions between different regions of varying stabilities
- Increased phase variability is furthermore consistent with the collective aim of the attacking team seeking to create spaces within otherwise contained dynamic game configurations

- The adoption of the environment-performer system as unit of study helps understanding how sport techniques, tactical strategies, decisions, and actions emerge without over-reliance on encapsulated predefined hierarchical structures - such as brain processors or motor programs.
- Complexity science applications include: How groups of cyclists, runners, or sport fans are spontaneously formed during practice or competition; and, how decisions to shoot or to pass, to dribble or to score, to advance up field or to stay back, to attack or to wait emerge without previous programs stored in the brain of the players
- Early applications focused on motor control and learning, via limb or finger movements that were then modelled
- In sport, decision making is seen as a self-organising process that emerges as a consequence of an athlete interacting with the environment around them
- Here we have a time line of the changing basketball game score and location of the data sequences extracted for analysis (upper panel). The individual data sequences and the time line of important game events, including team in possession, type of play, shot attempts, steals, fouls, and out of bounds (lower panel).

# Ecological Dynamics
]


???
- This approach treats the performer-environment system as a relevant level of analysis and explanation in sports settings. The approach is based on two theoretical and formal pillars such as: ecological psychology of perception[15] and Haken’s synergetics approach[16], as a relevant one in dealing with problems of dimension reduction and self-organization in complex nonlinear systems and their dynamical formulation
- ED involves where behavior is a self-organizing phenomenon that emerges from the continuously dynamic interplay of an organism’s characteristics and the affordances (possibilities for action) offered in a specific competitive performance environment 
- Skilled behavior therefore evolves over timescales of performance, learning, and development. Ecological dynamics is grounded in Gibson's work on perception in ecological psychology and Kelso's work on coordination dynamics. 
- The perception and action of an individual are tightly coupled, so think a team-sport athlete responding to where their direct opponent is moving, the flight of the ball and the direction of the wind, as they attempt to catch or mark a ball.

- There is an over-emphasis on the measures of performance outcome variability (such as standard deviations and coefficients of variation) in sport and movement science research, which typically focuses on the magnitude of variability in task outcomes.
- This is only part of the picture and biased to the view that variability is often equated with “noise” or error in humans, considered as information-processing channels. This conceptualization is likely due to the linear movement models that were popular in motor behavior theories in the 1960s to the 1970s and that somewhat still prevail in current practice
- Variability in such systems needs to be much more carefully interpreted in a nuanced way, which is the challenge for sports practitioners interested in enhancing athlete and team performance.
- Understanding the change in variability profile at each level, in particular during any interaction with motor learning and/or adaptation, could provide insight into how any functional role of variability emerges.
- Movement pattern variability can support the skill adaptations needed as the influence of task constraints on athlete behaviors emerges during practice and performance. 
- The implications for practice and performance were captured in the phrase of “repetition without repetition,” indicating how practice designs for trainers and coaches should provide opportunities for athletes to solve performance problems in different ways using a variety of behaviors.
- The ecological dynamics framework has emphasized how the role of the sports practitioner has evolved from an autocratic instructor and more to an instructor with a deep understanding of task, personal, and environmental constraints on individual learners and finding ways to co-design learning environments replete with affordances to guide each learner toward active exploration of a range of performance solutions

- A predominant challenge facing sports practitioners is the design and implementation of training environments that represent competition
- This approach to training design has been referred to as representative learning design (RLD)
- Theoretically, RLD advocates for training to consist of key (informational) constraints that are experienced within competition to maximise the transfer of skill from training to competition
- We know how constraints can be classified including into Individual (e.g., physical attributes and emotions), Task (e.g., rules and ground dimensions) and Environmental (e.g., weather and gravity) classes
- To assist with the design of representative training tasks, practitioners typically record the constraints of a competitive environment to ensure such constraints are designed into training
- Understanding how these constraints interact and influence an athlete's behaviour is an ongoing challenge, due to non-linearity
- The primary aim of this study was to compare constraint interactions and their frequencies, between match simulations, SSGs, and competition matches in AF

- A pressured handball performed within 2s was the most frequent in matches and match simulations 
- The likelihood of the third disposal being effective varied across the different environments. Here we have competition matches (green), match simulations (red) and Small Sided Games (purple). The third disposal in the sequence or chain of disposals was more likely to be effective in SGGs, relative to competition matches and match simulation.

- Assess similarity between training activities and competitive matches

???
- Match simulations generally showed greater similarity to competition matches, with respect to disposal type. However, competition matches incurred a greater frequency of pressured handballs performed within 2s (Rule G), relative to match simulations
- These differences between training and competition environments could exist for a number of practical reasons. Notably, the design features of the SSGs could intentionally favour a specific disposal type (e.g. kick), whilst, in general, the training environment could incur less physical pressure relative to a competitive match, given differences in physical exertion and intensity

--

- Use the frequency of constraints to improve the representativeness of training

???
- Practitioners may therefore use this information to better understand the influence of constraints on performance, which could, improve the representativeness of such training tasks through informed manipulation, such as increasing (or decreasing) playing field dimensions to encourage differing levels of pressure on disposals
- Better understand the design of training tasks that may aid practitioner decision-making in implementing appropriate SSGs for their desired intent.


--

- Discover non-frequent constraints, to target specific areas

???
- Although it is likely that practitioners’ do not plan for every training task to express near perfect representativeness, this methodology provides a platform by which ‘target’ areas could be identified, informing practitioners as to how frequent non-representative actions are performed within practice. 
- Such information could better guide the macro- and meso- structures of practice, ensuring less representative training tasks are coupled with more representative tasks.

--

- Understand the complexity and sequential nature of constraints

???
- Differences between the training and competitive performance environments were found when exploring the observed frequency of a third sequential disposal being classified as ‘effective’. Understanding disposal sequences is a key feature of complexity. 
- This is essential for RLD as it enables understanding of not just the current status, but which interactions occur after.
- For matches and match simulations, the observed frequency of an effective third sequential disposal was lower compared to the SSGs. 
- This practice task yielded the highest range of observed frequency for an effective third disposal, likely due to the task design of the SSGs, which may encourage a more continuous, effective, chain of disposal.
- this could have been intentionally designed within the SSGs through the systematic manipulation of player numbers (task constraint) to favour the offensive team
