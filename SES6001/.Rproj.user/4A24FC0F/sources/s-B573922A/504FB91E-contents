# Data Hurdles in Sport Science

### `r fa("database", fill = "black")` Importing data from wearables/ different platforms and exports .csv/ .pdf/ .txt etc
--
<br>
### `r fa("clock", fill = "black")` Synchronising data from different systems at differing sample rates

### `r fa("asterisk", fill = "black")` Dealing with messy, manual, incomplete data sets!

The challenge we all face is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes, even demands, hyperspecialization
